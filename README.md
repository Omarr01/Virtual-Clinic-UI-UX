# Virtual-Clinic-UI-UX
Derived functional requirements as user stories (Requirements Engineering and Analyzing a Problem Scenario) and designed and created a clickable mockup for a virtual clinic (using Marvel).

The overarching theme of this project is to create an online virtual clinic management
software. A virtual clinic management software is a software solution for clinics, doctors,
and patients alike to streamline and automate the interactions between patients and
medical doctors. This encompasses everything from trying to find a doctor, scheduling
meetings with doctors, conducting on-premise or online meetings, getting prescriptions,
getting reminders for follow ups, accessing medical history, and even requesting a doctor
change.
